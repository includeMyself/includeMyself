- 👋 Hi, I’m @includeMyself aka Filippo when I'm not in the Zone
- 👀 I’m interested in C++, C, Bash Scripting, Python, Processing, Gnu/Linux (these are my main skills but I studied other programming languages too and I don't have problem to work on other Os, ide, editors, etc...)
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to improve my skills in C++, (Good Luck to Myself ahah)
- 💞️ I’m looking to have more hours of sleep available, maybe a normal work, (and someone who wants to destroy indentation errors with me eheh). In any case I love to programming, and I would do it anyway.
